# Ansible-Auto-Generated-Modules

This is a collection of Ansible modules generated using AnsibleDscModuleGenerator found here:
https://github.com/trondhindenes/AnsibleDscModuleGenerator

The Ansible modules in this repo roughly correspond to the available DSC resources found in the PowerShell Gallery, https://www.powershellgallery.com/

This repo is pushed to Docker, so you can easily run a Docker image containing all these modules by using the following Docker command:
`docker run -it trondhindenes/docker-ansible-win-automated bash`
